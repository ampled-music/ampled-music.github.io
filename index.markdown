## Welcome to our Bylaws

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/blackmetal.jpg' quote='This is the rulebook for Ampled. This document explains how shared ownership works, how decisions are made, and how profit is shared.' -%}

<br>

## Our Mission

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/hardcore.jpg' quote='Our mission is to make music more equitable for artists and to operate transparently and ethically.' -%}

<br>

## Our Charter

Our charter represents core values of Ampled. Any decisions made by Ampled or any ambiguity in these Bylaws should be considered with reference to these points:

1. **Ampled will be a steward and advocate of artist interests**. We will make decisions and articulate goals based on their positive impact on artists and the communities in which we operate.

2. **Ampled will democratize ownership**. We will be an inclusive and equitable organization owned by our artists, workers, and community.

3. **Ampled will default to transparency**. We will be an open organization and honestly share our vision, decisions, challenges, and failures.

4. **Ampled will be accountable to its members**. There will always be artist participation and control at the highest levels of corporate governance and decision making.

5. **Ampled will be a sustainable vehicle for artist prosperity**. We will seek to deliver long-term value to artists, not an exit or acquisition.

6. **Ampled will operate in accordance with its values**. We will use fair and transparent terms of use and privacy policies and will never sell data to any 3rd party.

<br>

## Ownership

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/powertrip.jpg' quote='There are 3 classes of ownership. Artists, Workers, and Community.' -%}

<br>

Ampled has 3 kinds of Owners

**Artist-Owners**

Artists contribute by creating and launching an artist page and receiving support. Artist-Owners elect representatives to the Board, and vote on major decisions.

**Worker-Owners**

Workers make most decisions about the day-to-day operations of Ampled. Worker-Owners elect representatives to the Board, and vote on major decisions.

**Community-Owners**

Community-Owners elect representatives to the Board and vote on major decisions.

Each ownership class elects 3 representatives to the 9 seat Board of Directors. The Board primarily oversees Workers to ensure their work is accountable to all Owners and fulfills the mission of Ampled.

<br>

### **Owners of Ampled**

* An “Owner” is legally a member of Ampled. 

* It’s possible for Owners to be two or more kinds of Owners at once, meaning they have the rights and responsibilities of those two or more Owner categories, but they will still have only one vote on any decision put to Owners or on the election of any Director seat. 

* Organizations and businesses that are Owners get only one vote, regardless of how many people work for or own that organization or business.

* An Owner cannot transfer their ownership interest to other people. 

<br>

### Becoming an Artist-Owner

Any person may become an Artist-Owner by: 

1. Creating an artist page that receives 10, or more, supporters.

Each admin of an artist page that has received 10 or more supporters may become an Artist-Owner.

<br>

### Becoming a Worker-Owner

Any person may become an Artist-Owner by completing the following requirements: 

1. Being a regular contributor for Ampled for 6 months or 80 hours, whichever comes first. Regular contributions are defined as those contributing a minimum of 3 hours per month.

2. Being approved by ⅔ of Worker-Owners in a vote to be held within one month of completing the period of work above, and 

3. Aligning and agreeing: Committing to the Charter in these Bylaws and completing an Owner Agreement.

The Board and Workers, together and at their discretion, may approve as a Worker-Owner a contributor in close collaboration with the workers in a non-employee capacity.

Employees not approved by vote: An employee who is not approved by the above vote of Worker-Owners shall either be terminated as a contributor or employee or given an opportunity to improve their performance over a period of 3 months. After that period, there shall be another vote. If the contributor or employee is not approved as a Worker-Owner by the second vote, their involvement with Ampled or employment shall be terminated.

**Initial Worker-Owners:** The following individuals are Worker-Owners as of the adoption of these Bylaws on 04/01/2020: Ana Ulin, Ariel Farias, Austin Robey, Blair Gardner, Collin Lewis, Dash Lunde, Derek Singleton, Emma Cunningham, Joshua Harvey, Molly Mary O’Brien, René Kladzyk, Ryan DeShon, and Sean Adams.

<br>

### Becoming a Community-Owner

To be affordable to everyone, dues are set at a one-time payment of $25 for a two-year membership. Dues help cover the costs of Ampled’s operations and events. Dues are not refundable. It is encouraged, but not required for Community-Owners to be supporters of artists on the Ampled platform.

<br>

### Terminating Ownership 

Ownership will terminate by any of the following; 

* An Owner sends Ampled a written notice that they are terminating their ownership. 

* An Owner dies. 

* In the case of a business or organization that is an Owner, they dissolve or close.

* The Board otherwise expels an Owner for cause, as long as the Board uses a consistent, fair, and reasonable procedure for expulsion (provided in writing to the Owners) that gives an Owner a reasonable period of time in which to explain or correct a problem. 

In the case of an Artist-Owner, they delete their artist page, or are considered “inactive”. “Inactivity” shall be defined by the Board in a manner determined to be reasonable and equitable.

In the case of a Worker-Owner, they cease to work for or be employed by Ampled, within the last trailing 6 month period, unless on a temporary leave. 

In the case of a Community-Owner, they do not make a payment of dues for more than 24 months and fail to make a dues payment within 30 days of notice of non-payment.

<br>

## Board of Directors

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/pop.jpg' quote='Our board of directors are elected representatives that serve as stewards of their constituent interests. No VC investors here.' -%}

<br>

Except as otherwise provided, the Cooperative will have 9 Directors (aka Board members) and they serve 1 year terms.

### Roles and Responsibilities of the BoardO

The primary role of the Board is to create and oversee a system of decentralized, participatory, and inclusive governance and operations. In other words, the Board generally stewards the process by which work is carried out, as opposed to directing the substance of the work. The Board will provide ongoing oversight of the activities and internal functioning of the Cooperative. This will include:

Regularly reviewing financials and financial decisions, changes to employee compensation, and periodic budget review. 

* Monitoring compliance with the law. 

* Reviewing internal policies adopted by Workers. 

* Making reasonable inquiry into any concerning activities or decisions by Staff. 

* Intervening when the Cooperative’s Workers or Owners engage in overly risky or illegal activity.

### Board Elections

Elections will take place within 30 days before or after Dec 1 every year. By the end of 2020, the Board will create and disseminate a clear process for holding elections, which shall include: 

* An open process for soliciting nominations. The invitation for nominations will begin in November, to allow a long enough window of time to recruit, nominate, learn about, and engage with candidates, before voting starts, 

* Opportunities for candidates to communicate with Owners, 

* A voting process that encourages high voter turnout, 

* A ranked-choice voting system that allows Owners to rank their top three or more choices for each Board seat. After 2020, only the Owners may vote to change election processes.

### Transition to Full Board

An election will be held for 3 Worker Directors and 3 Artist Directors in December 2020, who shall serve until December 2021. 

An election will be held for 3 Worker Directors, 3 Artist Directors, and 3 Community Directors in December 2021.

### Director Recall

A Director may be removed by whomever elected that particular Director. For example, the Worker-Owners may vote to remove a Worker-Director, using the process below. 

Every Director subject to removal must be given a reasonable opportunity to provide a written statement to the voters or organization removing them prior to the vote or decision of removal. Removal by vote of Owners: A vote to remove a Director may be initiated by a proposal of the Directors or by the ownership class that elected that Director following the procedures described under “Owner Proposals and Meetings.” Additional voting requirements: 

* If there are fewer than 50 Owners in a particular Owner category, removal of a Director elected by that category must be approved by majority of ALL Owners in that category. 

* If there are more than 50 Owners in a particular category, removal can be done by majority vote, so long as at least 30 Owners or 5% of Owners (whichever is larger) in that Owner category participate in the vote. 

Removal or suspension by the Board: The Board may remove any Director who has not attended three or more consecutive regular or special Board meetings. Without prior notice, the Board may also suspend for cause any Director, so long as 2/3 of Directors, not including the Director subject to suspension, vote to approve suspension. The Board will promptly notify the affected Director of such suspension and will provide an opportunity for the suspended Director to be heard at a meeting of the Board of Directors within 30 days. 

Replacing Directors: In the event that an elected Director is removed, the removal vote shall also indicate whether (i) a replacement Director shall be elected within four months of removal, (ii) the Board shall appoint a replacement until the next regularly scheduled election, or iii) the seat shall remain vacant until the next regularly scheduled election. If the President is removed, the Treasurer shall act as President until a new President is elected. If the Treasurer or Secretary is removed, the Board will appoint any other sitting Board member to fill those roles until the replacement is elected.

### Board Meetings

The Board will meet at least quarterly, with at least 15 days notice. Any 2 Directors may call additional Board meetings with at least 7 days notice. Meetings may happen on even shorter notice if all Directors are present or later agree, in writing, to decisions made at the meeting. A Director may participate virtually in in-person Board meetings if they request to do so at least 3 hours in advance, to allow the Board to set up appropriate technology. Meetings may also be entirely virtual.

### Board Decisions

In meetings, decisions are made when approved by a majority of all Directors, except where a higher voting threshold is required elsewhere in these Bylaws or another policy. The Board may make decisions outside of a meeting if ALL Directors consent to the decision in writing.

### Owner Meetings

The Board will organize at least 1 Owner meeting per year and give Owners at least 30 days notice, describing the agenda and topics to be voted on. The Board will organize additional Owner meetings at its discretion or if a meeting is requested by 5% of Owners. In this case, the Board will give Owners at least 10 days notice. By joining the Cooperative, Owners consent to the holding of virtual meetings.

### OWner Proposals and Meetings

If requested by 5% of Owners or if requested by 2 Board members, the Board will put a proposed decision or discussion topic on an Owner meeting agenda or submit a proposal (virtually or by mail) to the Ownership for a vote outside of a meeting. Votes may be taken in or outside of meetings using paper, electronic voting, or raised hands. A quorum for meetings and votes is 5% of Owners or 5 Owners, whichever is larger. Owner decisions may be made by majority vote, except where a higher voting threshold is required by these Bylaws or another policy. Regardless of the number of Ownership classes held by an Owner, each Owner shall have one (and only one) vote on any decision put to Owners, or on the election of any Director seat.

### Conflict of Interest Policy

When the Board or Workers are thinking about entering into a transaction that might benefit the financial interest of someone who is part of that deciding body, the applicable deciding body shall use the following process to vet the transaction. The general standard of review is whether or not a transaction would benefit the person’s financial interest to the detriment of the Owners or the Cooperative. Key definitions: 

* Interested Person: A person who – personally or through a member of their household – has a direct or indirect financial interest, defined as: 

* Financial Interest: Direct financial benefit from the transaction or an actual or potential ownership interest, investment, compensation interest, or governance role in an entity that Ampled is transacting with.

### Communications from Ampled

The Cooperative may provide notice, ballots, and any other communications to Owners, Workers, and Directors by mail, text message, email, or another electronic platform accessible to Owners and Directors. By joining the Cooperative, an Owner consents to receiving notice and other communications via email, and to using an electronic voting platform. An Owner or Director may withdraw this consent by requesting – in writing sent to the Ampled Secretary – that communications be made available to the Owner or Director in non-electronic form.

### Binding the Cooperative

The Secretary, President, or Treasurer may sign a document or make a binding commitment on behalf of the Cooperative. The Board may designate other people, such as certain Directors to do the same.

<br>

## Changing the Bylaws

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/folk.jpg' quote='This is a living document. Here is how these bylaws can change.' -%}

Prior to the first Board election, these Bylaws may be changed by approval of a majority of Initial Worker-Owners.

Once a Board has been elected, with exceptions listed below or on a specific Bylaws page, these Bylaws may be changed by approval of 2/3 of Owners at a duly called Owner meeting, or by 2/3 of those voting by electronic ballot duly submitted to Owners, so long as a quorum participates. Exceptions include: 

1. Changes to the Bylaws (including formatting changes) not affecting the decision-making power or financial rights of Owners may be made by approval of 2/3 of the Board. 

Each time a page in the Bylaws is amended, the Board Secretary will email a copy of the new Bylaws to all Owners, and will put the Bylaws on the Ampled website. The website will include an archive of all old Bylaws. Each page of the Bylaws will include a date showing when it was most recently amended, so that Owners can easily see where changes have been made.

<br>

## Capped Compensation

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/rap.jpg' quote='Capped compensation protects against runaway salaries and unfair pay ratios.' -%}

<br>

Worker compensation shall not exceed 3.5 times the median per capita wage for all occupations in the New York City Metropolitan area, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its most current Area Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates. For example, as of 2019, the median salary for all occupations in this region is $50,825. In this case, an Ampled employee could not be allowed to make more than $177,887 per year for full time work.

Salaries of leadership may be no more than 3 times the average employee’s compensation.

<br>

## Profit Sharing

{%- include image_quotes.html image_source='assets/gothrap.jpg' quote='Profit is redistributed back to members.' -%}

<br>

After the end of every fiscal year, Ampled shall do the following: 

1. Determine available surpluses for reallocation.

2. Allocate some or all surpluses to Owners as patronage refunds among involved Owners, following the procedures described under  “How Surplus Is Redistributed”.

If, instead of surpluses, there are losses, the losses will be allocated in any manner that the Board determines to be fair and equitable, in consideration of the circumstances leading to the loss.

### **How Surplus is Distributed**

1. **Giving Surpluses to Artist-Owners:** 75% of surpluses available for allocation are paid to active Artist-Owners pro rata based on the amount of total support received by the particular active Artist-Owner through Ampled.

2. **Giving Surpluses to Worker-Owners:** 12.5% of surpluses available for allocation are paid to active Worker-Owner. This is determined in any manner that the Board determines to be fair and equitable, in consideration of both the amount of time worked towards Ampled and by the value of contribution.

3. **Giving Surpluses to Community-Owners:** 12.5% of surpluses available for allocation are paid to Community-Owner and distributed equally amongst each Community-Owner. If the Board determines that the amount of surplus allocation to Community-Owner is too small to justify the administrative cost of making patronage refunds, net income for Community-Owners may be re-invested in the Cooperative to expand activities that benefit Ampled’s mission.

<br>

## Will & Testament

Any proposal to sell, dissolve, or liquidate the Cooperative must be approved by 2/3 of all Owners and 2/3 of all Directors. In such an event, after paying or adequately providing for all debts, liabilities, and repayment to contributors, the Cooperative shall make payments in following the procedures described under “How Surplus Is Distributed”

### Defending and Compensating Directors, Officers, Staff, and Owners

Ampled shall have the power to indemnify its Directors, Officers, Workers, Owners, and their agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Ampled shall compensate a Director, Officer, Worker or Owner for any expenses incurred from lawsuits, penalties, fines, and costs of defense if the person incurred these expenses in connection with fulfilling their duties as a Director, Officer, Staff or Owner. This is also called “indemnification.” However, Ampled is not obligated to “indemnify” a person if such expenses arose from a situation where the person stole funds, knowingly received funds they were not entitled to, intentionally committed a crime, or recklessly or intentionally harmed Ampled or its Directors, Officers, Workers, or Owners.
